This toolkit is designed for the Xiaomi Mi A2, if you have a different device and want to try it, please be careful. This program uses ADB commands that could brick other devices. Enable the logs to see what commands it runs.

What can this toolkit do?
It can unlock your bootloader(s),
backup and restore using ADB,
flash new firmware and third party roms,
unbrick your device (in most instances, no promises, a lot can go wrong),
revert your device to stock,
root your device,
enable camera2 api,
tell you all the system commands it is running and why (enable noob mode, it will help you not to be such a noob),
enable Vo-LTE for T-Mobile in the USA,
link you directly to the latest version of a stock image, magisk, rooted boot image, and the telegram.

Please forgive the bugs! I have never written anything in C# before this program.
